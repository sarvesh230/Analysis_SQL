## Hi there 
In this repository i had made a project where i analyse the data of zomato (gold member subscription) . I used MS SQL SEREVER for this and with different SQL function.
I had learned some advanced level skills, which helps me to analyse difficult key metrics out of the datasets.

-- Q4) what is most purchased item on menu & how many times was it purchased by all customers ?

-- Q5) which item was most popular for each customer?

-- Q6) which item was purchased first by customer after they become a member ?

-- Q7) which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

-- Q8)  what is total orders and amount spent for each member before they become a member?

-- Q9)  If buying each product generates points for eg 5rs=2 zomato point and each product has different purchasing points for eg for p1 5rs=1 zomato point,for p2 10rs=zomato point and p3 5rs=1 zomato point  2rs =1zomato point, calculate points collected by each customer and for which product most points have been given till now.
